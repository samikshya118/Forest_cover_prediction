# 🌲 Forest Cover Type Prediction
This project aims to classify forest areas into one of seven cover types using supervised machine learning. Using environmental and cartographic features, the model predicts forest types based on terrain data.

## 📌 Project Objectives
Predict forest cover type using classification models

Perform detailed EDA to understand geographical feature patterns

Improve predictions through feature engineering and data cleaning

Optimize model performance with tuning and evaluation

## 📊 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following features:

Elevation: Height above sea level (in meters)

Aspect: Direction the slope faces

Slope: Steepness of the slope

Horizontal/Vertical Distance to Hydrology

Soil Type: 40 binary features

Wilderness Area: 4 binary features

Cover_Type: Target variable (7 forest categories)

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost

Platform: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
